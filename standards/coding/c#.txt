1. Data Types
Use int Instead of Unsigned Types: It's recommended to use int for integer values as it provides better compatibility with many libraries and eases interaction across different parts of code. Learn more.
2. Naming Conventions
Class and Method Names: Always use PascalCase for naming classes and methods.
Example: public class UserProfile { }
Method Arguments and Local Variables: Use camelCase.
Example: public void UpdateUser(int userId, string userName) { }
Interface Naming: Prefix interface names with an 'I'.
Example: public interface IUserService { }
Avoid Underscores: Do not use underscores in identifiers to maintain clarity and consistency. 
3. Whitespace and Formatting
Indentation: Use 2 spaces for indentation instead of tabs, ensuring uniformity across your codebase.
Statement Per Line: Limit to a maximum of one statement per line to enhance readability.
Column Limit: Aim for a maximum line length of 100 characters to prevent horizontal scrolling and enhance readability.
4. Code Quality Practices
Exception Handling: Implement robust exception handling to manage runtime errors effectively.
Boolean Short-Circuiting: Use && and || for boolean operations to optimize performance and readability.
