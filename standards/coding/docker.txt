Minimize layers:

Combine RUN commands using && and \ for line continuation
Use multi-stage builds to reduce final image size


Order instructions from least to most frequently changing:

Put instructions that change less often at the top of the Dockerfile
This optimizes caching and speeds up builds


Use .dockerignore file:

Exclude unnecessary files from the build context
Improves build performance and reduces image size


Set the WORKDIR:

Use WORKDIR instead of RUN cd ...
Prefer absolute paths for WORKDIR


Use environment variables:

Define common values as ENV variables
Use ARG for build-time variables


Don't run processes as root:

Create a non-root user and use USER instruction to switch to it
Example:
dockerfileCopyRUN adduser -D myuser
USER myuser



Use COPY instead of ADD:

COPY is more transparent
Use ADD only for auto-extracting archives


Use exec form of CMD and ENTRYPOINT:

Use CMD ["executable", "param1", "param2"] instead of CMD executable param1 param2
This ensures proper signal handling


Include HEALTHCHECK instruction:

Helps Docker determine if the container is functioning properly
Example:
dockerfileCopyHEALTHCHECK CMD curl -f http://localhost/ || exit 1



Use appropriate logging:

Configure your application to log to stdout/stderr
This allows Docker to handle log management


Clean up in the same layer:

If you need to run commands that create temporary files, remove them in the same RUN instruction
Example:
dockerfileCopyRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    package1 \
    package2 \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*



Use multi-stage builds for compiled languages:

Build in one stage, copy the binary to a smaller runtime image
Reduces final image size significantly


Label your images:

Use LABEL to add metadata to your image
Include information like maintainer, version, description


Keep application data separate:

Use volumes for persistent data
Don't store data in the container itself


Specify default configurations:

Set sensible defaults for your application
Allow overriding through environment variables


Pin package versions:

When installing packages, specify exact versions
Ensures reproducibility across builds


Use appropriate instructions for adding files:

Use COPY for adding local files to your image
Use ADD for URLs and tar extraction


Document exposed ports:

Use the EXPOSE instruction to document which ports your application uses
This doesn't actually publish the ports, but serves as documentation
